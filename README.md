# Data Structures and Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms. As a dedicated computer science student, I've worked hard to understand and implement these fundamental concepts. Below is an overview of the contents of this repository:

## Contents

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation:**
    - `bst.py`: This file contains the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. It includes methods for insertion, deletion, search, traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and depth-first search (DFS). Additionally, it provides functionality to find the minimum and maximum values in the tree.

2. **Hash Table Implementation:**
    - `hash_table.py`: This file implements a Hash Table data structure using separate chaining for collision resolution. It includes methods for adding key-value pairs, retrieving values by key, and printing the hash table.

3. **Max Heap Implementation:**
    - `max_heap.py`: This file contains the implementation of a Max Heap data structure. It includes methods for insertion, retrieval of the maximum element, and depth-first traversal.

4. **Linked List Implementation:**
    - `linked_list.py`: This file implements a Singly Linked List data structure. It includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and reversing the linked list.

5. **Stack Implementation:**
    - `stack.py`: This file contains the implementation of a Stack data structure. It includes methods for push, pop, peak, and checking if the stack is empty or full.

## Usage

Each Python file includes class definitions and example usage at the end of the file. You can run these files directly to see the implementations in action and test different scenarios.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements or would like to add more data structures or algorithms, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
